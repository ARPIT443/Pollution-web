Follow these Tips Every Day to Reduce Pollution:

1.Conserve energy - at home, at work, everywhere.
2.Look for the ENERGY STAR label when buying home or office equipment.
3.Carpool, use public transportation, bike, or walk whenever possible.
4.Follow gasoline refueling instructions for efficient vapor recovery, being careful not to spill fuel and always tightening your gas cap securely.
5.Consider purchasing portable gasoline containers labeled “spill-proof,” where available.
6.Keep car, boat, and other engines properly tuned.
7.Be sure your tires are properly inflated.
8.Use environmentally safe paints and cleaning products whenever possible.
10.Mulch or compost leaves and yard waste.
11.Consider using gas logs instead of wood.

# What is the AQI?

The AQI is an index for reporting daily air quality. 
It tells you how clean or unhealthy your air is, and what associated health effects might be a concern.
 The AQI focuses on health effects you may experience within a few hours or days after breathing unhealthy air. The AQI is calculated for four major air pollutants regulated by the Clean Air Act: ground level ozone, particle pollution, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide. For each of these pollutants, EPA has established national air quality standards to protect public health. EPA is currently reviewing the national air quality standard for nitrogen dioxide. If the standard is revised, the AQI will be revised as well.

# How does the AQI work?

Think of the AQI as a yardstick that runs from 0 to 500. 
The higher the AQI value, the greater the level of air pollution and the greater the health concern.
 For example, an AQI value of 50 represents good air quality with little or no potential to affect public health, while an AQI value over 300 represents air quality so hazardous that everyone may experience serious effects.
An AQI value of 100 generally corresponds to the national air quality standard for the pollutant, which is the level EPA has set to protect public health. AQI values at or below 100 are generally thought of as satisfactory.
 When AQI values are above 100, air quality is considered to be unhealthy—at first for certain sensitive groups of people, then for everyone as AQI values increase.

Unhealthy:-
1. preventions:-
    >Children, seniors and individuals with respiratory or heart diseases should avoid sustained and high-intensity outdoor exercises. General population should moderately reduce outdoor activities.
    >Before going out or engaging in outdoor activities, get into the habit of verifying the air quality index in your area. This way, you can determine when you should take precautions to safeguard your health.
    >As a precaution, keep your medication with you.
    >Avoid areas where the air is polluted.
    >Contribute to the reduction of outdoor air pollution.
    >Use methods of transportation that help reduce the amount of pollutants in the air:
      .Public transport
      .Walk or bike (when air quality is good)
      .Carpool
    >Limit the use of fireplaces and wood stoves in the winter because such appliances contribute a great deal to smog during the cold season. Make sure that you maintain these appliances properly. For more details, visit the MDDELCC’s Wood Heating.
    >Maintain good indoor air quality. 
    >Pay attention to the air quality inside your home because it could also be harmful to your health.
    >Certain outdoor pollutants, such as fine particles and ozone, can also get into your house. Other pollutants may already be present, including:
      .Tobacco smoke
      .Smoke from fireplaces and wood stoves
      .Mould and other contaminants associated with excessive humidity
      .Volatile organic compounds, mainly formaldehyde, from:
      .Household products, such as paints and varnishes
      .Construction material, such as chipboard or plywood panels
      .Carbon monoxide emitted by some appliances and vehicles during the combustion of propane, wood, fuel, etc.
      .Radon, an odourless, colourless radioactive gas that can seep into buildings
      .Asbestos from brittle or damaged material that has been sawn, sanded, etc. 
    >Do not smoke indoors.
    >Fix water infiltration problems to prevent mould growth
    >Opt for healthy and environmentally friendly household products and materials
    >Limit the use of wood-burning appliances
    >Install a carbon monoxide detector, and avoid using appliances that operate on fuel (gasoline, propane, etc.) indoors
    >Measure the concentration of radon in your home with a dosimeter. You can do it yourself or hire an expert
    >Learn about the possible sources of asbestos in your home and take the appropriate precautions, especially if you are doing renovations
    >Opening your windows regularly is an inexpensive and effective measure. However, you should keep your windows shut when outdoor air quality is poor and during periods of extreme cold. 

 **Be sure to also:
    >Always turn on the range hood when cooking. The hood should be vented outside.
    >Turn on the bathroom fan each time someone takes a shower or a bath
    >If you have a central ventilation system (also known as an air exchanger), operate it according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

2.health effects:-
    1.Ozone affects the lungs and respiratory system in many ways.
 It can:
    .Irritate the respiratory system, causing coughing, throat soreness, airway irritation, chest tightness, or chest pain when taking a deep breath.
    .Reduce lung function, making it more difficult to breathe as deeply and vigorously as you normally would, especially when exercising. Breathing may start to feel uncomfortable, and you may notice that you are taking more rapid and shallow breaths than normal.

    2.The risk of exposure to unhealthy levels of ground-level ozone is greatest.
          during warmer months. Children, who often play outdoors in warmer
          weather, are at higher risk.
    3.Inflame and damage the cells that line the lungs. Within a few days, the damaged cells are replaced and the old cells are shed—much like the way your skin peels after sunburn. Studies suggest that if this type of inflammation happens repeatedly, lung tissue may become permanently scarred and lung function may be permanently reduced.

    4.Make the lungs more susceptible to infection. Ozone reduces the lung’s defenses by damaging the cells that move particles and bacteria out of the airways and by reducing the number and effectiveness of white blood cells in the lungs.
    5. When ozone levels are unhealthy, more people with asthma have symptoms that require a doctor’s attention or the use of medication. Ozone makes people more sensitive to allergens—the most common triggers for asthma attacks. Also, asthmatics may be more severely affected by reduced lung function and airway inflammation. People with asthma should ask their doctor for an asthma action plan and follow it carefully when ozone levels are unhealthy.

    6.Aggravate other chronic lung diseases such as emphysema and bronchitis. As concentrations of ground-level ozone increase, more people with lung disease visit doctors or emergency rooms and are admitted to the hospital.




3.WHAT CAN I DO?
   -Every time we drive to school, use our heater or air conditioner, clean our windows, or even style our hair, we make choices that affect air pollution. These steps, as well as many others, are things we all can do to help reduce air pollution.
   -Conserve energy – remember to turn off lights, computers, and electric appliances when not in use.
   -Use energy efficient light bulbs and appliances.
   -Participate in your local utility’s energy conservation programs.
   -Limit driving by carpooling, using public transportation, biking and walking.
   -Combine errands for fewer trips.
   -Keep your automobile well tuned and maintained. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions on routine maintenance, such as changing the oil and filters, and checking tire pressure and wheel alignment.
   -Avoid excessive idling of your automobile.
   -Use electric or hand-powered lawn care equipment.
   -Be careful not to spill gasoline when filling up your car or gasoline powered lawn and garden equipment.
   -Run dishwashers and clothes washers only when full.
   -Choose environmentally friendly cleaners.
   -Use water-based or solvent free paints whenever possible and buy products that say "low VOC".
   -Seal containers of household cleaners, workshop chemicals and solvents, and garden chemicals to prevent volatile organic compounds from evaporating into the air.
   -Purchase and use low-polluting outboard marine engines and personal watercraft (4-stroke and direct fuel injection 2-stroke outboard marine engines).
   -Advocate for emission reductions from power plants and more stringent national vehicle emission standards.
